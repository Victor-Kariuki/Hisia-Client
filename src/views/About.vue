          Social media has for a long time now been a means for people to express their needs,
          preferences and emotions. From this, a large amount of information is generated from the
          preferences and behavior of users. The majority of the data that is constantly generated
          in the social networks could contain valuable information like perceptions and tendencies
          from the users to the objects, personalities or services.
          To process the data that exists in the social networks is the process known as sentiment
          analysis / opinion mining.
